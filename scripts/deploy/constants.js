// N.B. The image deployed should be capable of serving both
// sites and blogs. The difference in configuration is in the
// number of cpus, memory, and maxOldSpaceSize only.

// We need more overhead between maxOldSpaceSize and memory
// for the site servers because they need to run chromium
// and pandoc for building posts. The blog servers don't.
//
// The airlock sidecar (AIRLOCK.memory below) is paid for out of these
// three, not on top of them, so the host's total stays where it was:
// 512m for the airlock, taken as ~512/3 off each of the app containers.
// The overhead between memory and maxOldSpaceSize shrinks by that ~170m -
// still ample for the site servers today, and the chromium half of what it
// covers moves out to the airlock entirely at the traffic cutover, so it
// can come down further then. Watch `docker stats` after the first deploy;
// if a container is tight, restore its memory and take more from the
// others (yellow has the least headroom to give).

  cpus: 2, // we overcommit cpu slightly

// The blog servers only have a single node.js process and

// gap between memory and maxOldSpaceSize can be smaller.

  // Deployed as a single, standalone container - not blue/green/yellow -
  // on its own Docker network. App containers are NOT given `--network
  // blotnet` at `docker create` (that would move their default gateway off
  // the bridge they're on today - see config/airlock/README.md's production
  // note); instead the deploy script `docker network connect`s each app
  // container to it between `docker create` and `docker start`, so they keep
  // their original bridge network and gateway and gain a second interface
  // that can reach `blot-airlock`. Attaching the network before start (not
  // after, as originally written) matters: connecting a network to an
  // already-running container drops its in-flight connections - it was
  // killing the app's established connections to the off-box Redis instance
  // seconds after each deploy, one crash-restart per container.
  //
  // memory is deliberately tight. Idle (nginx + tinyproxy + a headless
  // Chromium with no page open) this sits under ~300m; it held up in
  // testing to three back-to-back full 1200x1200 @2x screenshots with no
  // OOM. Real bookmark-screenshot rendering and remote-image downloads run
  // here now (config.airlock), serialized across the app containers by the
  // lock in app/helper/screenshot, so concurrent load on it stays low. This
  // 512m is taken out of siteConfig/blogsConfig above, not added on top -
  // see the note there; the app containers can shed more of their own
  // Chromium overhead once the follow-up PR drops that binary.

Usage: npm run translate <url>

Builds a Blot template reproducing the design of <url>.

Requires the development server to already be running:

  npm start

Content is not fetched by this script. After the site is scaffolded you will be
asked to move content into its folder — see scripts/development/dynamic-importer
or Blot's dashboard importers.

This script does not fetch content. Move the site's content into:

Ways to get it there:

  * WordPress, Squarespace, Blogger or Are.na
      Use Blot's dashboard importer, then unzip the result into the folder.
      $DASHBOARD_URL

  * Any other live site
      npm run dynamic-importer $URL

  * Anything else
      Copy files in by hand, or try one of the demo folders in
      app/templates/folders/ to exercise the template loop.

Posts need a 'Date:' line in their metadata or a dated path (2024/03-12-name.txt)
for dates to be meaningful — Blot does not read the file's modified time.

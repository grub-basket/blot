# `npm run translate <url>` — Research

Research notes for a development script that builds a **Blot template** which
reproduces the design of an existing website, working against content that is
already sitting in the site's folder.

The script:

1. Verifies the development server is already running, and aborts if it is not.
2. Creates (or reuses) a site on the local development account.
3. Configures it for local folder editing and scaffolds a locally-edited template.
4. **Pauses for the operator to move content into the folder**, and verifies it
   arrived.
5. Invokes the Claude Code CLI to build the template against that content and the
   design at `<url>`, iterating against screenshots with operator feedback.
6. Leaves the folder ready for the operator to review and zip by hand, so it can be
   handed to a customer who drops it into their own site folder.

**Content acquisition is explicitly not this script's problem.** Getting a site's
writing out of WordPress, Squarespace, Blogger or a bare HTML site is a separate
concern with different failure modes, and it lives in
`scripts/development/dynamic-importer` (crawling) or in Blot's existing dashboard
importers (platform exports). This script assumes content exists and concentrates
entirely on the design.

That separation buys something practical: the template half can be built and
tested **today**, against the demo folders already in the repo (`david`, `bjorn`,
`clara`, `lecture`, `thoughtforms`), using a real site URL purely as the visual
target. The whole verification loop is exercisable before any crawler exists.

Everything below was verified against the code in this repository. File paths are
repo-relative. Where the shipped documentation disagrees with the code, the code
behaviour is stated and the discrepancy flagged.

## 0. Executive summary of what must be built

### 0.1 The actual deliverable

**The deliverable is the site folder itself — content plus template — sitting at
`data/blogs/<blogID>/`.** The script does not archive it. The operator reviews the
result and zips the folder by hand when they are happy with it.

```
data/blogs/<blogID>/
├── README                          ← handover notes (ignored by Blot, §6.5)
├── 2024/03-12-a-post.txt           ← content, supplied by the operator
├── 2024/03-12-a-post/              ← (directory form when the post has assets)
│   ├── post.txt
│   └── _hero.jpg
├── Pages/
│   └── About.txt
├── .verification/                  ← screenshots + agent notes; scaffolding only
├── .git/                           ← history stays local (§6.10)
└── Templates/
    └── <slug>/                     ← what this script actually produces
        ├── package.json            ← needs "enabled": true  (see §5.1)
        ├── README
        ├── entries.html
        ├── entry.html
        ├── style.css
        └── …
```

Dropped into a customer's own folder, that tree reproduces the site — including
installing the template, via the `"enabled": true` mechanism in §5.1.

Because both `.git/` and `.verification/` are dot-directories, macOS Finder's
select-all-then-compress excludes them automatically. That is deliberate (§6.4,
§6.10): the operator's zip contains the site and nothing else, with nothing to
remember.

### 0.2 Phases

| Phase | What happens | Reuse | New work |
|---|---|---|---|
| A. Preflight | Confirm the dev server is up at `config.host`; abort with instructions if not | `/health` endpoints (§1.5) | reachability check |
| B. Provision | Create or reuse the blog on the local dev account, set `client: "local"`, `forceSSL: false`, `git init` | `app/templates/folders/setupUser.js`, `setupBlogs.js`, `app/configure-local-blogs.js` | thin wrapper |
| C. Template scaffold | `Template.create` → `setMetadata({localEditing:true})` → `writeToFolder` → ensure `"enabled": true` | `scripts/test/setup-restore-git-test.js` is a working example | the `enabled` injection (§5.1) |
| D. Content handoff | Prompt the operator to move content in; **verify entries actually built** before continuing | — | the wait-and-verify gate (§3) |
| E. Template authoring | Claude Code writes Mustache views + `package.json` + CSS into `Templates/<slug>/` | — | prompt design |
| F. Verify & iterate | Screenshot both sides, compare in a local UI, take operator feedback, resume the agent | `app/helper/screenshot`, `scripts/development/open-folder-server.js` | comparison UI + feedback loop |

The single biggest architectural fact: **the template is just files in
`data/blogs/<blogID>/Templates/<slug>/`**. A chokidar watcher picks up every change
and rebuilds — verified end to end in §1.2. So the Claude Code CLI never needs an
API; it edits a directory.

---

## 1. Development environment

### 1.1 Stack layout

`scripts/development/start.sh` boots `scripts/development/docker-compose.yml`:

- `node-app` — image `blot`, Dockerfile target `dev`, runs
  `nodemon /usr/src/app/app/index.js`. Container name is `blot-node-app-1`.
- `redis` — 6.2.12-alpine, port 6379 exposed to the host.
- `toxiproxy` — injects Redis latency once the app reports readiness (disabled
  during startup and during nodemon restarts). `BLOT_USE_TOXIPROXY=false` opts out.
- `nginx` (openresty) — ports 80/443, terminates TLS for `local.blot`.

`start.sh` also runs `node scripts/development/open-folder-server.js` **on the host**
(port 3020) so the dashboard's "open folder" button can `open -R` a real Finder path.

### 1.2 Host ↔ container path mapping (critical)

From the compose file, `../../data:/usr/src/app/data` — so:

```
host:      /Volumes/Blot/blot/data/blogs/<blogID>/
container: /usr/src/app/data/blogs/<blogID>/
```

`config/index.js` sets `blog_folder_dir = BLOT_DATA_DIRECTORY + "/blogs"` and
`helper/localPath(blogID, path)` resolves to `<blog_folder_dir>/<blogID>/<path>`.

**Consequence:** the Claude Code CLI can run on the host, in
`data/blogs/<blogID>/`, and its edits are seen by the container. The
`app/clients/local` chokidar watcher will pick them up and rebuild.

**This was flagged as a risk and has now been tested empirically — it works.**
Procedure and results, run against this machine's stack:

1. Set a scratch blog to `client: "local"` and started the watcher in the master
   process by publishing to `clients:local:new-folder` (§2.4).
2. Wrote `watcher-test.txt` at the folder root **from the host**. The container
   synced it **within the same second**:
   `sync_4008d0a client=local /watcher-test.txt Saving file in database succeeded`,
   followed by `Building templates from folder` and `Updating cacheID of blog`.
3. Wrote a nested `2026/01-15-nested.txt`. Also picked up; `Entries.getAllIDs`
   returned both paths.
4. Deleted both from the host. Both were dropped:
   `/2026/01-15-nested.txt Dropping from database succeeded`.

So Docker Desktop's bind mount propagates inotify events for creates, nested
creates and deletes. **No `--rebuild` fallback is required for correctness.**

**Three caveats that do affect the design:**

- **The watcher only sees changes made while it is listening.** It is started
  with `ignoreInitial: true`, and only after `sync/fix` has finished, so content
  already sitting in the folder when the watcher starts is invisible to it —
  permanently, not just late. `sync/fix` does not compensate: it removes ghosts
  of deleted files, it never discovers new ones. Anything that puts content into
  a folder out-of-band must therefore walk it and call `folder.update()` per path
  (as `app/templates/folders/index.js` does) rather than waiting for a sync that
  will never come. Note also that the watcher holds the folder lock for each
  event it processes, so an explicit rescan has to retry: `sync` itself gives up
  after roughly eleven seconds.

- **Latency is variable.** Creates landed instantly, but the delete sync landed
  roughly half a minute after the `rm` — file events go onto a per-blog
  `async.queue`, each item takes a `proper-lockfile` lock on the folder, and syncs
  are serialised. A verification loop must therefore **wait for a settling signal
  before re-screenshotting**, not poll immediately. `blog.cacheID` is bumped at the
  end of every sync (`Updating cacheID of blog`), which makes it a usable
  "the rebuild finished" marker.
- **Deletes are soft.** `Entries.getAllIDs` still returns removed paths; the entry
  is marked `deleted: true` rather than dropped from the index (verified). Any
  check for "is this post gone" must read the flag, not the ID list.

### 1.3 Existing `npm run` script conventions

`package.json` scripts wrap either a bash file in `scripts/development/` or a
`docker exec`:

```json
"folder":  "./scripts/development/folder.sh",
"login":   "docker exec -it blot-node-app-1 /bin/sh",
"featured":"docker exec blot-node-app-1 node app/documentation/featured/build",
```

`scripts/development/folder.sh` is the closest structural precedent for the new
script: validate an argument, print usage when absent, then
`docker exec blot-node-app-1 npx nodemon app/templates/folders ... "$FOLDER_NAME"`.

Module resolution inside the container relies on `ENV NODE_PATH=/usr/src/app/app`
(Dockerfile), which is why app code does `require("models/blog")`,
`require("helper/localPath")`, `require("config")` etc. Any Node script that
touches models **must run inside the container** (or set `NODE_PATH` and have a
reachable Redis — Redis *is* exposed on host port 6379, so a host-side script is
possible but would need `BLOT_DATA_DIRECTORY` pointing at the repo `data/`).

Recommendation: keep model manipulation inside `docker exec`, and run the Claude
Code CLI on the host.

### 1.4 Config values that matter

`config/index.js`:

| Key | Dev value |
|---|---|
| `environment` | `development` (unless `NODE_ENV=production`) |
| `host` | `process.env.BLOT_HOST` — `start.sh` defaults it to `local.blot` |
| `protocol` | `https://` |
| `cdn.origin` | `https://cdn.local.blot` |
| `blog_folder_dir` | `<repo>/data/blogs` |
| `blog_static_files_dir` | `<repo>/data/static` |
| `tmp_directory` | `<repo>/data/tmp` |

Site URL is therefore `https://<handle>.local.blot`.

### 1.5 Preflight — the server must already be running

**The script does not start the stack.** It assumes `npm start` is running in
another window, and aborts with a clear message if it is not. Starting the stack
from inside `translate` would be wrong: `start.sh` is long-lived and interactive
(it tails logs, manages toxiproxy, and traps `INT`/`TERM` to save Redis and tear
down the compose project), so it cannot be composed into a one-shot script.

**Health endpoints** (both verified returning `200 OK` against the running stack):

| URL | Handler |
|---|---|
| `https://<config.host>/health` | `app/site/index.js:49` — the site vhost |
| `http://localhost:8080/health` | `app/server.js:116` — the Express catch-all, `Cache-Control: no-store` |

Check `https://<config.host>/health` rather than `localhost:8080`, because it
exercises the whole path the script actually depends on: nginx → TLS → vhost
routing → the `config.host` value the rest of the script will build URLs from.

**Local DNS and TLS on this machine** (verified):

- `/etc/resolver/blot` contains `nameserver 127.0.0.1`, so a local resolver maps
  `*.blot` — including wildcard subdomains such as `<handle>.local.blot` and
  `preview-of-x-on-y.local.blot` — to `127.0.0.1`. There is **no** `/etc/hosts`
  entry for `local.blot`; do not look for one.
- `config/openresty/setup.sh` generates a wildcard cert for `$BLOT_HOST` and
  `*.$BLOT_HOST` with `mkcert` into `data/ssl/`, and `mkcert -install` trusts it.
  It exits early if `data/ssl/certs/wildcard.crt` and `.../private/wildcard.key`
  already exist.

Because the cert is only trusted if `mkcert -install` has run on that machine, the
preflight should tolerate an untrusted cert (`curl --insecure`, or Node with
`rejectUnauthorized: false`) — a TLS trust failure is not the same as the server
being down, and shouldn't produce a misleading error.

**Suggested preflight sequence, each with its own remedy message:**

1. `docker ps` lists `blot-node-app-1` → else "the development stack is not
   running; run `npm start` in another window".
2. `GET https://<config.host>/health` returns `200` within a short timeout → else
   the same message (the container can be up while the app is still booting or
   mid-nodemon-restart, so a couple of retries with a short backoff is reasonable).
3. Optional: confirm the dev account and its blogs exist. They are created by
   `app/configure-local-blogs.js` at boot, so a successful (2) implies (3) — but
   an explicit check gives a better error than a downstream crash.

Note the `BLOT_HOST` resolution order the script must mirror: `start.sh` defaults
it to `local.blot` and passes it into compose, while `config/index.js` defaults to
`localhost` when the variable is absent. A script running on the **host** without
`BLOT_HOST` set would compute `localhost` and check the wrong URL. Read
`BLOT_HOST` from the environment with a `local.blot` default (matching
`start.sh`), or read the effective value out of the container:

```bash
docker exec blot-node-app-1 node -e 'console.log(require("config").host)'
```

The second form is authoritative and worth preferring.

## 2. Provisioning a site on the local development account

### 2.1 Where `example@example.com` comes from — investigated

**It is a hardcoded literal, not configuration.** `app/configure-local-blogs.js`
lines 6–7:

```js
const email = "example@example.com";
const password = "password";
```

There is no env var, no config key, and no `.env` entry behind it. It is not
`config.admin.email`, and it is not overridable without editing that file.
`grep -rn "example@example.com" app scripts config` returns only this file plus
documentation prose (`app/views/about/notes/_guides/_development-application-state.txt`,
which tells developers to run `node scripts/user/create example@example.com …`)
and a test fixture in `scripts/email/newsletter.js`.

`app/configure-local-blogs.js` runs at startup **in development only** — the
module exports `main` when `config.environment === "development"` and a no-op
otherwise. It:

- Ensures user `example@example.com` / password `password` exists
  (`User.getByEmail` → `User.hashPassword` → `User.create`).
- Creates a blog with handle `example` if the user has none.
- For every blog owned by that user: `Blog.set(blogID, { forceSSL: false, client })`
  where `client` falls back to `"local"` when unset.
- Prints the capability banner (`Local server capabilities: …`) plus a magic-link
  dashboard URL from `User.generateAccessToken`, the blog URL, and the folder path.

**The second account, for contrast.** `app/templates/folders/setupUser.js` uses:

```js
const FOLDER_ACCOUNT_EMAIL = config.admin.email || "folders@example.com";
```

`config.admin.email` is `process.env.BLOT_ADMIN_EMAIL` (`config/index.js:74`),
and **`BLOT_ADMIN_EMAIL` is not set in this repo's `.env`** — the file only
defines Stripe, PayPal, webhooks, session, Dropbox, Google Drive, iCloud and
Tumblr variables. So in practice that account is literally
`folders@example.com`, and it owns the demo folder blogs (`bjorn`, `clara`,
`david`, `documentation`, `hypertext`, `lecture`, `programmer`, `sergey`,
`thoughtforms`).

**Resolution:** attach translated sites to `example@example.com`. It is the
account `npm start` logs the developer into, it is the one whose blogs get
`client: "local"` and `forceSSL: false` applied automatically on every boot, and
keeping translated sites off `folders@example.com` avoids polluting the demo-folder
account that `app/templates/folders/index.js` manages and prints URLs for.

The script should still **look the user up rather than assume it exists**
(`User.getByEmail`, create if absent, mirroring `configure-local-blogs.js`) so it
works against a fresh Redis where the boot hook has not completed. If the email
ever needs to vary, the honest fix is to hoist the literal out of
`configure-local-blogs.js` into `config` — worth considering, but out of scope.

### 2.2 Blog creation API

`app/models/blog/create.js`:

```js
Blog.create(uid, { handle, title, timeZone, dateFormat, ... }, function (err, blog) { … })
```

- Generates `blogID` (`blog_<32 hex>` — see existing `data/blogs/` entries).
- Merges `app/models/blog/defaults.js`.
- Validates via `app/models/blog/validate/` before writing.
- `fs.emptyDir(localPath(blogID, "/"))` — creates the folder.

Relevant defaults (`app/models/blog/defaults.js`):

```js
client: "", template: "SITE:blog", timeZone: "UTC", dateFormat: "M/D/YYYY",
forceSSL: true, permalink: { format: "{{slug}}", custom: "", isCustom: false },
menu: [ Home /, Archives /archives, Search /search, Feed /feed.rss ],
plugins: build/plugins.defaultList, imageExif: "basic", cacheID: 0
```

### 2.3 Handle validation

`app/models/blog/validate/handle.js`:

- lowercased, trimmed
- `/^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$/` — **letters and digits only**, no hyphens or underscores
- 2–70 characters
- not in `app/models/blog/validate/banned.txt`
- not already taken (`err.code === "EEXISTS"`)

**Implication:** a handle derived from a URL must be aggressively sanitised.
`https://www.example.com/blog` → `examplecom` or `exampleblog`. Collisions need a
numeric suffix (still alnum-only, so `examplecom2` works).

### 2.4 Switching the blog to the local client

Two equivalent routes:

```js
Blog.set(blogID, { client: "local", forceSSL: false }, cb);
```

then run setup so the watcher starts:

```js
require("clients/local").setup(blogID, cb);   // exported for scripts/tests
```

**But that only helps inside the master process.** Calling `setup()` from a
`docker exec` starts a chokidar watcher in that short-lived process, which dies
when the process exits — verified. To make the *server* watch the folder you must
publish to the Redis channel the master process subscribes to:

```js
redisClient.publish(
  "clients:local:new-folder",
  JSON.stringify({ blogID })      // ← JSON object, NOT a bare blog ID
);
```

**The payload must be JSON.** `app/clients/local/init.js:46` does
`let { blogID } = JSON.parse(message)`. Publishing a bare ID throws
`SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'b' … is not valid JSON` in the server log and the
watcher never starts — verified by doing exactly that. Note
`app/clients/local/README` describes this only as "messages containing blog IDs",
which is what led to the mistake; the code is the contract.

`init.js` also re-initialises every `client === "local"` blog 5 s after boot, so a
server restart re-establishes all watchers regardless.

`app/clients/local/setup.js`:

- runs `sync/fix` on the blog
- **only in `config.environment === "development"`** starts a `chokidar` watcher on
  `localPath(blogID, "/")` with `ignoreInitial: true`
- every event is pushed into an `async.queue`; each item runs
  `Sync(blogID, (err, folder, done) => folder.update(path, …))`
- the watcher closes itself if `blog.client !== "local"`

`Sync` (`app/sync/index.js`) takes a `proper-lockfile` lock on the blog folder,
runs updates, then on release: checks renames, calls
`models/template.buildFromFolder(blogID)`, bumps `blog.cacheID`.

**That last point is important**: every sync also rebuilds templates from the
folder. So a content-file change and a template-file change both converge on the
same code path.

### 2.5 Reference implementations to copy

- `app/templates/folders/index.js` + `setupBlogs.js` + `setupUser.js` — the full
  "create user → create blogs → copy a source folder in → sync changed paths →
  print URLs" flow, promisified. `applyChanges()` shows how to call `sync()` and
  `folder.update()` directly rather than relying on the watcher.
- `app/templates/folders/config.js` — per-handle overrides (`title`, `template`,
  `menu`, `plugins`). Same shape the translate script will want.
- `scripts/blog/create.js` — CLI-shaped blog creation with confirmation prompt.
- `scripts/test/setup-restore-git-test.js` — creates a blog template, enables
  local editing, resolves the on-disk template directory. Near-verbatim reusable.

## 3. The content stage

This script does not acquire content. It waits for it, checks it arrived, and then
tells the agent what it is looking at.

### 3.1 How content gets into the folder

Three routes, all the operator's choice, none of them this script's code:

| Source | Route |
|---|---|
| WordPress, Squarespace, Blogger, Are.na | Blot's existing dashboard importer — open the site's dashboard, **Import**, upload the export, download the resulting ZIP |
| Any other live site | `scripts/development/dynamic-importer` — agent-driven crawl, see its own `RESEARCH.md` |
| Anything else | Hand-made files, an existing folder, or one of the repo's demo folders under `app/templates/folders/` |

The script prints the target path (`data/blogs/<blogID>/`), opens it if useful —
`scripts/development/open-folder-server.js` already runs a host-side opener on port
3020 that `spawn`s `open -R` — and waits.

### 3.2 Verify, do not trust

"Press enter when ready" is not good enough on its own, because the folder watcher
is asynchronous: files can be present on disk while entries have not been built
yet, and sync latency is variable (§1.2). Check the database, not the filesystem:

```js
Entries.getAllIDs(blogID, (err, ids) => { … })
```

**`getAllIDs` includes soft-deleted entries** — verified: a removed file leaves its
path in the index with `deleted: true` on the entry. So filter on the flag rather
than counting IDs.

A reasonable gate: at least one non-deleted entry exists, `blog.cacheID` has
settled (§1.2), and no template errors are present in `metadata.errors`. Report
what was found — "42 posts, 3 pages, 6 tags" — so the operator can spot a partial
copy before the agent spends a turn on it.

### 3.3 What the agent needs to know about the content

The agent is building a template *for this specific folder*, so it should inspect
what is there rather than assume. The conventions that shape a template:

| Convention | Effect on the template |
|---|---|
| `Pages/` sub-folder | entries become pages and appear in `{{#menu}}`; usually needs distinct styling from posts |
| `[Bracket]` tags in paths, or `Tags:` metadata | drives `/tagged/:tag`, `tagged.html`, and any tag navigation |
| Date in the path (`YYYY/MM-DD-name.txt`) or `Date:` metadata | whether `{{date}}` is meaningful, and whether `archives.html` is worth building well |
| A page with `Link: /` | the homepage is a bespoke landing page, not a post list — `entries.html` moves to `/page/1` |
| `_`-prefixed files | assets, not posts; referenced from within entries |
| Custom metadata keys | available as `{{entry.metadata.<key>}}` and may deserve template support |

Full user-facing reference: `app/views/how/metadata.html`,
`app/views/how/sub-folders/*.html`. The mechanics of how files become entries live
in `app/build/README` and in the dynamic-importer research; the template only needs
the resulting shape, which is §3.4.

**The agent may edit content.** Some mismatches with the source design are content
problems, not CSS problems — a bespoke homepage needs `Link: /` metadata, a section
needs `[Bracket]` tags before tag pages can exist, a post needs a `Summary:` for a
teaser to read well. Constraining the agent to `Templates/` would force bad
workarounds. Content edits are in scope during the verification loop (§6.4), and
git makes them reviewable (§6.10).


### 3.4 Entry properties available to templates

Full list in `app/views/developers/reference.yml` (rendered at `/developers/reference`).
Condensed:

**Identity/content:** `id` (= `path`), `guid`, `path`, `name`, `size`, `html`,
`body` (html minus `titleTag`), `titleTag`, `title`, `summary` (≤150 chars,
excludes headings/code), `teaser`, `teaserBody`, `more`, `slug`, `permalink`,
`index`.

**URLs:** `url`, `absoluteURL`.

**Dates:** `date` (pre-formatted, absent for pages/menu items or when
`hide_dates`), `dateStamp`, `created`, `updated`, and the lambdas `formatDate`,
`formatUpdated`, `formatCreated` (moment tokens in the block body).

**Taxonomy:** `tags[]` (`tag`, `name`, `slug`, `url`, `first`, `last`),
`tagged.<Tag>` (flat lookup object for conditionals), `backlinks[]`.

**Media:** `thumbnail.{small,medium,large,square}.{url,width,height}` (never
upscaled), `exif` (`off`/`basic`/`full` per site setting).

**Flags:** `menu`, `page`, `deleted`, `draft`, `scheduled`.

**Other:** `metadata` (custom keys, also mirrored lowercase).

## 4. Template side

### 4.1 Model

`app/models/template/README` is the authoritative reference (read it in full
before implementing). Key facts:

- A template is owned by a `blogID` or by the literal string `"SITE"`.
- Template ID = `<owner>:<slug>`, e.g. `SITE:blog`, `blog_abc…:mytheme`.
- All state lives in **Redis** (`template:{id}:info`, `template:{id}:view:{name}`,
  `template:{id}:all_views`, `template:{id}:url_patterns`, `template:{id}:url:{url}`).
- Metadata fields: `id name slug owner cloneFrom shareID errors previewPath
  isPublic description localEditing thumb locals cdn`.
- View fields: `name content partials locals retrieve url urlPatterns`.

### 4.2 Locally-edited templates: the lifecycle

**Enable (what the dashboard does)** — `app/dashboard/site/template/index.js`
route `/:templateSlug/local-editing` POST:

```js
Template.setMetadata(templateID, { localEditing: true }, err => {
  Template.writeToFolder(blogID, templateID, () => {});
});
```

**Disable** — `Template.removeFromFolder` then `setMetadata({localEditing:false})`.

**Write out** — `writeToFolder.js`:
- requires `isOwner(blogID, templateID)`
- picks the directory via `determineTemplateFolder` → `Templates` or `templates`
  (prefers whichever already exists; if all existing root entries are lowercase it
  chooses `templates`, else `Templates`)
- writes `Templates/<metadata.slug>/package.json` (generated by `package.generate`)
  plus one file per view named `view.name`
- **skips any view without `content`**
- removes orphaned files that are no longer views
- writes through the blog's client *and* directly with `fs.outputFile`

**Read back** — `buildFromFolder.js` → `readFromFolder.js`, called on every sync:
- scans `localPath(blogID, "/templates")` and `"/Templates"`
- for each sub-directory: create the template if missing, parse `package.json`
  (forcing `localEditing = true`), drop views whose files vanished, then
  `setView()` per file
- skips `package.json`, dotfiles, ignored files, **directories**, and files
  `> 2.5 MB`
- `view.url = view.url || "/" + view.name`
- if `package.json` has `"enabled": true` → `Blog.set(blogID, { template: id })`
- Mustache parse errors and JSON errors are captured into `metadata.errors`
  keyed by view name, with improved line/position messages, and surfaced on the
  preview subdomain
- locally-edited templates whose directory disappears are **dropped**

### 4.3 `package.json` format

Produced by `app/models/template/package.js#generate`, consumed by `#save`:

```json
{
  "name": "Blog",
  "isPublic": false,
  "enabled": true,
  "locals": { "page_size": 20, "background_color": "#FFFFFF", "…": "…" },
  "views": {
    "archives.html": {
      "url": "/archives",
      "locals": {},
      "partials": {
        "title": "Archives - {{{title}}}",
        "description": "All the entries posted on {{{title}}}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- `url` may be a string or an **array** of patterns; it is only emitted when it
  differs from the default `/<viewName>`.
- `partials` here are **inline string partials** scoped to that view — the
  templates use them for `<title>` and `<meta description>`.
- `locals` at the top level are template-wide; per-view `locals` are merged at
  render time.
- `enabled: true` is how a folder template installs itself as the active template.
  `removeEnabledFromAllTemplates.js` clears it from the others.

A real example is `app/templates/source/blog/package.json` (quoted in §4.7).

### 4.4 View naming and routing — the actual behaviour

`readme.txt` in `app/templates` claims "The template `foo.html` would be rendered
at the url `example.com/foo`". **This is not what the code does.**
`helper/urlNormalizer.js` only adds a leading slash, strips a trailing slash,
collapses `//`, and lowercases — it does **not** strip extensions. And
`getViewByURL.js` matches the normalized pathname against stored patterns.

So the default route for `archives.html` is `/archives.html`, which is exactly why
**every** shipped template overrides it in `package.json`:

```
album, blog, documentation, event, fieldnotes, gallery, index, journal, keynote,
links, magazine, portfolio, profile, studio, text, wireframe, zine
    → "archives.html": { "url": "/archives" }
cv        → "writing.html": { "url": "/writing" }
hypertext → "search.html": "/search", "pagination.html": "/pagination/:page"
links     → "tags.html": "/tags"
```

URL patterns go through `path-to-regexp`, so `:param` segments work
(`hypertext`'s `/pagination/:page`), and matched params land on `req.params` and
`res.locals.request.params` (`app/blog/view.js`).

**Views with hard-wired routes** (handled by dedicated route files in
`app/blog/`, not by URL patterns):

| View | Route file | URL |
|---|---|---|
| `entries.html` | `entries.js` | `/` and `/page/:page` |
| `entry.html` | `entry.js` | any URL resolving to an entry |
| `tagged.html` | `tagged.js` | `/tagged/:tag`, `/tagged/:tag/page/:page` |
| `search.html` | `search.js` | `/search?q=` |
| `error.html` | `error.js` | 404 / render failures |

Route priority in `app/blog/index.js`: vhosts → renderView middleware →
loadTemplate → draft → tagged → search → robots → **entry** → **view** →
entries → assets → random → error. Templates are matched **before** static files,
so a view URL can shadow a file in the folder.

### 4.5 Partials

- `{{> header}}` resolves to a view. `getView` tries the exact name first, then
  compares against each view name with its extension stripped — so `{{> header}}`
  finds `header.html`.
- SITE templates in `app/templates/source/` use a leading-underscore file naming
  convention (`_head.html`); `app/templates/index.js` strips the `_` when deriving
  the view name, so the stored view is `head.html` and the reference is `{{> head}}`.
  **`readFromFolder` does not strip underscores** — in a locally-edited template a
  file called `_head.html` becomes the view `_head.html`. For folder-based
  templates, name the file `header.html` and reference `{{> header}}`.
- `{{> /Pages/Home.md}}` — a partial whose name starts with `/` is looked up as an
  **entry path** and rendered as that entry's HTML (`getPartials.js`). Only
  non-deleted, non-draft, non-scheduled entries resolve.
- Inline string partials come from `package.json` `views[view].partials`.
- `setView` runs infinite-partial-cycle detection.

### 4.6 Locals available at render time

`app/blog/render/retrieve/index.js` is the whitelist. `parseTemplate.js` scans the
Mustache AST and only requests locals whose names appear in that directory.

**Site properties** (always in context): `title`, `avatar`, `roundAvatar`, `menu[]`
(`id label url metadata active first penultimate last`), `cacheID`, `updated`,
`timezone`, `siteURL`, `blogURL`, `feedURL`, `sitemapURL`.

**Retrievable locals** (snake_case canonical, camelCase aliases kept for
compatibility):

```
absolute_urls  active         all_entries    all_tags       app_css/plugin_css
app_js/plugin_js  archives    asset          avatar_url     cdn
css_url        encode_json    encode_uri_component  encode_xml
feed_url       folder         is             is_active      latest_entry
plugin         popular_tags   posts          recent_entries rgb
script_url     search_query   search_results tagged         total_posts  updated
```

`pagination` (`current previous next total page_size total_entries`) is set by
the `entries.js`/`tagged.js` route handlers. `page_size` baseline 5, valid 1–100;
tagged routes prefer `tagged_page_size`, default 100, valid 1–500.

`posts` respects template locals `sort_by`, `sort_order`, `page_size`,
`path_prefix`.

### 4.7 Anatomy of the simplest shipped template

`app/templates/source/blog/` — 15 files, the best starting point for a translated
template:

```
package.json   locals + per-view url/partials
_head.html     <head>: title/description partials, RSS link, favicon,
               preconnect + {{#cdn}}/style.css{{/cdn}}, full OG/Twitter card set
_sidebar.html  logo/avatar + {{#menu}} links
_footer.html   <script src="{{#cdn}}/script.js{{/cdn}}">
entries.html   {{#posts}} full {{{html}}} + date + tags, hr between
entry.html     {{#entry}} {{{html}}}, date, tags, {{#adjacent}} prev/next,
               {{> pluginHTML}}
archives.html  {{#archives}}{{#months}}{{#entries}} + a /search form
tagged.html    {{#entries}} + {{#pagination}} with /tagged/{{slug}}/page/N
search.html    {{#query}} / {{#entries}}
error.html     {{error.title}} / {{error.message}}
feed.rss       {{#recent_entries}} with {{#formatDate}}ddd, DD MMM YYYY HH:mm:ss ZZ{{/formatDate}}
               and {{#encode_xml}}{{{body}}}{{/encode_xml}}
sitemap.xml    {{#menu}}{{#isPage}} + {{#all_entries}}
robots.txt     Sitemap: {{{siteURL}}}/sitemap.xml
style.css      main stylesheet (Mustache-rendered — locals usable)
plugin.css     plugin styling
script.js      client JS (Mustache-rendered)
```

Its `package.json` locals:

```json
{
  "page_size": 20, "hide_dates": false, "date_display": "MMMM D, Y",
  "background_color": "#FFFFFF", "text_color": "#111111", "links_color": "#111111",
  "font": { "id": "verdana", "font_size": 11, "line_height": 1.8 },
  "title_font": { "id": "gill-sans", "font_size": 19 }
}
```

Other templates worth reading for specific patterns: `album` (photo grid +
photoswipe), `documentation` (multi-level nav, TOC, breadcrumbs, i18n),
`hypertext` (custom `:page` route, search form), `magazine` (many CSS/JS views),
`links` (list layouts), `cv`/`profile` (single-page).

### 4.8 Assets, CSS and the CDN

- **Template-owned assets** are views. CSS and JS views are rendered through
  Mustache, so `{{background_color}}` works inside `style.css`.
- Referencing them: `{{#cdn}}/style.css{{/cdn}}` produces a content-hashed CDN URL.
  `parseTemplate` statically extracts these targets into `view.retrieve.cdn`;
  `util/updateCdnManifest.js` renders, minifies, hashes, writes to
  `data/cdn/template/<h0:2>/<h2:4>/<h4:>/<basename>` and to Redis, and stores the
  `{target → hash}` map in `metadata.cdn`.
  - CDN manifests are **skipped for SITE templates** and for templates not
    currently installed on their owner blog.
  - `{{cdn}}` used as a plain variable yields the CDN origin (for `preconnect`).
- **Folder-owned assets** (images the crawler downloads) are rewritten after
  render by `app/blog/render/replaceFolderLinks/`:
  - `html.js` (parse5) rewrites `href`, `src`, `poster`, `srcset`
  - `css.js` rewrites `url(...)`
  - target form: `<cdn.origin>/folder/v-<hash>/<blogID>/<path>`
  - skipped for `req.preview` requests
- **Global static** served to every blog: `/fonts`, `/icons`, `/katex`,
  `/plugins`, `/syntax-highlighter` (`app/blog/assets.js`, one-year cache).
  `app/blog/static/layout.css` provides the classes for the Markdown layout tags.

### 4.9 Locals → dashboard controls (naming conventions)

Documented in `/developers/guides/dashboard-controls` and
`app/dashboard/site/template/load/README`. Getting these names right makes the
translated template configurable with zero extra code:

| Pattern | Control |
|---|---|
| `*_color` | color picker |
| `font`, `*_font` (except `syntax_highlighter_font`) | font picker |
| `*_url` | file upload |
| `navigation_*`, `*_navigation` | grouped navigation controls |
| `date_display`, `hide_dates` | date format select + toggle |
| `syntax_highlighter` `{ id }` (+ optional `syntax_highlighter_font`) | theme select |
| boolean value | toggle |
| `<key>` + `<key>_range: [min,max]` | slider (`page_size` always a slider) |
| `<key>` + `<key>_options: [...]` | select menu |

`app/templates/index.js` merges `body_font`/`font`/`navigation_font` with the
"System sans-serif" registry entry, `coding_font`/`syntax_highlighter_font` with
"System mono", and hydrates `syntax_highlighter` from
`blog/static/syntax-highlighter` (default `stackoverflow-light`). The same
hydration happens for blog templates via `injectLocals.js` on every metadata save.

### 4.10 Hard constraints (must be in the Claude Code prompt)

- **No subdirectories for view files.** `readFromFolder` skips directories
  outright. Everything lives in the template root.
- **No SCSS/Sass compilation.** Plain `.css` only.
- **View payload cap 2 MB** (`setView`); `readFromFolder` skips files > 2.5 MB.
- **View names** cannot contain `/` or `\` or start with `.`.
- **Avoid basename collisions** — `getView`'s extension-stripped fallback means
  `feed.xml` and `feed.rss` collide.
- Template names truncate at 100 chars, slugs at 30.
- Mustache is validated on save; failures land in `metadata.errors` and render an
  error page on the preview subdomain.
- `{{var}}` escapes HTML; use `{{{var}}}` for `url`, `path`, `html`, `body`,
  `avatar`, `siteURL` etc.
- Templates are **public**: `?json=true` / `?debug=true` exposes partial source,
  template locals and blog locals. Never put secrets in locals
  (`app/blog/README`, "Security invariant").

### 4.11 Debug and preview surfaces

- **`?json=true` or `?debug=true`** on any blog page returns the full render
  context as JSON (`app/blog/render/middleware.js:110`), `Cache-Control: no-cache`.
  This is the primary feedback loop for an agent authoring a template.
- **Preview subdomains** (`app/blog/vhosts.js`):
  - `preview-of-<template>-on-<handle>.<host>` — SITE template
  - `preview-of-my-<template>-on-<handle>.<host>` — blog-owned template
  - `preview.<template>.<handle>.<host>` — legacy
  In preview mode CDN rewriting is skipped and template parse errors render a
  dedicated error page.
- **Draft live-reload** — `GET /_draft/*` renders a draft; `GET /_stream/*` is an
  SSE stream on Redis channel `blog:{blogID}:draft:{path}`.
- **Screenshots** — `app/helper/screenshot` (puppeteer, Bottleneck-throttled,
  viewports `desktop 1260×778` / `mobile 400×650`).
  `app/templates/screenshots.js` shows the pattern: build preview URLs, capture to
  `app/views/images/examples/<template>/0.png` at 1060×780 with a 15 s timeout.
  A translate-verification step can screenshot the source URL and the local
  preview and diff them.

## 5. Keeping the folder portable

The script no longer produces an archive — **the operator zips the folder by hand
after reviewing it** (§0.1). But two things must be true of the folder on disk for
that manual zip to actually work in a customer's account, and both are easy to get
wrong, so the script should handle them.

### 5.1 Self-installation: `"enabled": true`

`readFromFolder.js#loadPackage` parses each template's `package.json`, forces
`localEditing = true`, and hands the parsed object to `package.save`. It then
reads the `enabled` flag off the *raw parsed package* — not off stored metadata:

```js
if (enabled === true) {
  Blog.set(blogID, { template: id }, …)   // installs the template
}
```

So a customer who copies the folder in gets the template built from disk *and*
installed as their active template, with no dashboard step. `buildFromFolder` runs
on every sync (called from `app/sync/index.js` on lock release), so this fires as
soon as their client syncs the new files.

**The gotcha — `writeToFolder` will never emit `enabled` for you.** `enabled` is
**not** in `app/models/template/metadataModel.js`. `package.save` only persists
`name`, `localEditing` and `locals`, deliberately dropping `enabled`. And
`package.generate` emits the key only `if (metadata.enabled)` — which is always
falsy for a stored template. The chain is:

```
package.json {enabled:true} → readFromFolder installs the template
                            → but `enabled` is never stored in metadata
                            → so writeToFolder regenerates package.json WITHOUT it
```

**So the script must write `"enabled": true` into the template's `package.json`
on disk itself** — read the generated file, add the key, re-serialise
(`JSON.stringify(pkg, null, 2)` matches the existing formatting). No Blot code
path will do it for you. The same omission is visible in the dashboard's own
`/:templateSlug/download-zip` route, which regenerates `package.json` via
`Template.package.generate` and likewise drops `enabled`.

**Two things can strip it back out again**, which matters now that the flag has to
survive on disk rather than being injected at packaging time:

- `Template.writeToFolder` regenerates `package.json` from stored metadata, so any
  dashboard edit or `writeChangeToFolder` call rewrites the file without `enabled`.
- `removeEnabledFromAllTemplates.js` explicitly rewrites `enabled: false` into
  every template's `package.json` whenever a different template is installed
  through the dashboard (`app/dashboard/site/template/index.js:90`).

Neither happens during a normal translate run, but both are plausible if the
operator pokes at the dashboard mid-review. **Re-assert the flag as the last step
of every run**, after the agent has finished and before handing back to the
operator, and mention it in the folder `README` so a human can restore it.

### 5.2 Portability: what must not end up in the folder

The operator zips the folder manually, so this is partly guidance for them (via
the `README`) and partly a constraint on what the agent is allowed to create.

| Item | Why | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `.verification/` | screenshots and agent notes — scaffolding, not the customer's content (§6.4) | delete before zipping; say so in the `README` |
| the agent brief, if kept in the folder | instructions to the translating agent, not to the customer | keep it in `scripts/development/translate/` and pass `--add-dir` instead (§6.8) |
| `Drafts/*.html` preview files | Blot writes a `.html` preview beside every draft (`app/sync/update/set.js` → `Preview.write`); generated artefacts | delete, or avoid creating drafts at all |
| `.DS_Store`, `._*`, `*.swp`, `~$*` | noise; some are silently skipped by Blot anyway | `clients/util/shouldIgnoreFile` already encodes the full list if you want to script the cleanup |
| `.git` and `.verification/` | both are dotfiles; Finder's select-all-then-compress excludes them automatically (§6.4, §6.10) | **nothing to do** — this is why both are dot-named. Blot also never publishes `.git`, and `/.git` is in `BLOCKED_PATTERNS` so it 404s over HTTP |
| CDN-absolute URLs (`https://cdn.local.blot/…`) | the dev host is baked in; the customer's CDN origin differs | template markup must use `{{#cdn}}/style.css{{/cdn}}` and folder-relative asset paths only, never a literal origin. `{{{cdn}}}` for `preconnect` is fine — it resolves per-blog at render time |
| Any absolute `data/blogs/<blogID>/` path | blog-ID specific | none should exist; worth grepping for before handing over |
| `Templates` vs `templates` casing | `determineTemplateFolder` prefers whichever already exists in the target folder, defaulting to `Templates` (or `templates` if every visible root entry is lowercase) | use `Templates/`. `buildFromFolder` scans **both** spellings, so either works on import |
| Template slug collisions | the customer may already have a template with that slug — `makeID` is `<blogID>:<slug>` | pick a distinctive slug from the source site, and note in the `README` that a same-slug template will be merged into |

A `grep` for `local.blot`, `cdn.local.blot` and the blog ID across the folder is a
cheap final assertion, and worth running automatically at the end of a run even
though the script is not doing the zipping.

### 5.3 Validating the result end to end

The strongest check, if it is ever wanted: **provision a second, empty blog, copy
the folder into it, let it sync, and screenshot it.** If `enabled: true` is doing
its job the second site renders identically to the first with zero configuration.
`app/templates/folders/index.js` already demonstrates every piece — create blog,
copy a source tree into `localPath(blogID, "/")`, `sync()` + `folder.update()` per
changed path, `fix()`. Not required for a first version; the operator eyeballing
the comparison UI covers the common case.

## 6. Wiring it together

### 6.1 Proposed shape

```
scripts/development/translate/
  RESEARCH.md          ← this file
  PLAN.md              ← implementation plan and status
  translate.sh         ← host entrypoint referenced by package.json

  finalize.js          ← IN container: re-assert "enabled": true, grep for

  capture.js           ← ON host: pair the shots, drop bad sources

  README.folder.md     ← template for the folder-root README   (§6.5)
  README.template.md   ← template for the in-template README   (§6.5)
```

No crawler, no importer, no packaging module: content arrives from elsewhere
(§3.1) and the operator zips the reviewed folder by hand (§0.1). **No agent
runner either** — the script prints a command rather than driving the CLI (§6.3).

```json
"translate": "./scripts/development/translate/translate.sh"
```

`translate.sh` — steps 5–8 form the operator loop:

1. **preflight** — `docker ps` for `blot-node-app-1`, then
   `GET https://<host>/health`; abort with "run `npm start` in another window"
   (§1.5). Resolve the host via
   `docker exec blot-node-app-1 node -e 'console.log(require("config").host)'`.
2. validate `<url>`, derive a stable alnum handle, **load run state** (§6.7). On a
   re-run: print the summary and prompt immediately for optional guidance.
3. `docker exec blot-node-app-1 node scripts/development/translate <url> <handle>`
   → provisions or reuses the blog, scaffolds the template, `git init`s the folder;
   prints `blogID`, template slug, site URL, dashboard URL as parseable output
   (the existing `preview-newsletter.sh` greps script output the same way)
4. **content gate** — print the folder path, wait, then verify entries actually
   built (§3.2). Skipped on a re-run where content is already present.
5. `cd data/blogs/<blogID>` and exec `claude -p …` — `--session-id` on a first run,
   `--resume` with the operator's feedback on subsequent turns (§6.3, §6.6.1).
   Non-zero exit or a `.verification/BLOCKED.txt` aborts the run.
6. wait for the rebuild to settle — poll `blog.cacheID` until stable (§1.2)
7. screenshot both sides into `.verification/` (host-side, §6.4); start the
   comparison server on 3021 and `open` it (§6.6.2)
8. prompt: Enter accepts, text becomes feedback → back to step 5, `q` aborts
9. `docker exec blot-node-app-1 node scripts/development/translate/finalize <blogID>`
   → re-asserts `"enabled": true` (§5.1), greps for host-specific strings (§5.2)
10. persist run state; print the folder path, the site URL and the preview URL


### 6.2 What `index.js` does (all inside the container)

```js
const user      = await getOrCreateUser("example@example.com");   // §2.1
const blog      = await Blog.create(user.uid, { handle, title });
await Blog.set(blog.id, { client: "local", forceSSL: false, timeZone, dateFormat });
await localClient.setup(blog.id);                       // starts the watcher

const template  = await Template.create(blog.id, name, { cloneFrom: "SITE:blog" });
await Template.setMetadata(template.id, { localEditing: true });
await Template.writeToFolder(blog.id, template.id);     // → Templates/<slug>/
await Blog.set(blog.id, { template: template.id });     // install it locally
```

That last `Blog.set` installs the template on the *dev* blog so it renders for
verification. It is unrelated to the customer-side install, which happens via
`"enabled": true` in the packaged `package.json` (§5.1).

**Decided: `cloneFrom: "SITE:blog"`.** The agent inherits `feed.rss`,
`sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`, `error.html`, the full OG/Twitter meta block and a
sane `package.json` — boilerplate that is fiddly to reproduce correctly and
invisible when it is wrong (a malformed RSS feed or a missing canonical tag will
not show up in a screenshot comparison).

**The cost to manage: anchoring.** Starting from a finished-looking template
invites the agent to tweak Blot's default look rather than rebuild the source
site's. Mitigate in the brief, explicitly:

- treat the clone as **structure and plumbing, not as a design**;
- rewrite `style.css` from scratch against the source site rather than editing the
  inherited rules;
- the inherited markup in `entries.html` / `entry.html` / `_head.html` is a
  starting skeleton — restructure it freely to match the source's DOM and
  semantics.

Worth checking during verification: if the output still looks recognisably like
Blot's default `blog` template, the anchoring happened and the brief needs
sharpening.


### 6.3 Handing over to the Claude Code CLI

**Decided after trying the alternative: the script does not run the agent. It
prints the command for the operator to run in another window.**

The headless route was built and abandoned. Driving `claude -p` meant owning
session-ID lifecycle, resume semantics, `PIPESTATUS` through a formatter pipe,
stream-JSON parsing, and a transcript file — and every bug in that milestone came
from the plumbing rather than from template translation. Two failures made the
case: passing `--session-id` on a re-run fails with *"Session ID … is already in
use"*, and the CLI refuses to start nested inside another Claude Code session.

Running it interactively is also a better fit for the work:

- the operator watches and can interject mid-task, which matters for a design job
  where "the nav is wrong" is faster said than inferred;
- permission prompts behave normally, rather than needing a blanket
  `acceptEdits` while the agent processes untrusted third-party HTML;
- session continuity is the CLI's own job (`claude --continue` in that folder);
- the terminal is the transcript, so nothing needs capturing.

The brief runs to ~180 lines, so it cannot be passed inline. Write it to
`.verification/brief.md` and print a single paste-able command:

```
cd <folder> && claude --model sonnet "$(cat .verification/brief.md)"
```

`claude` must still be **on the host** — the container has no binary and no
credentials — so preflight checks it exists before provisioning anything.

#### What the script gives up

It no longer knows whether the agent did anything: no exit code, no blocked
signal, no completion check. Acceptable, because the operator is watching. What
replaces it is the next run: it commits whatever changed, re-screenshots, and
shows the comparison.

#### Flags, for reference

These were verified against `claude` 2.1.47 while the headless route was being
built. Kept because they are the map if it is ever wanted back:

| Flag | Use here |
|---|---|
| `-p, --print` | non-interactive; print the result and exit. Skips the workspace-trust dialog, so only point it at trusted directories |
| `--output-format json` | single structured result object — parse instead of scraping text. `stream-json` gives realtime events if you want to surface progress |
| `--permission-mode acceptEdits` | let it write files without prompting. `bypassPermissions` is broader; `plan` is read-only |
| `--allowedTools` / `--disallowedTools` | scope it, e.g. allow `Edit`, `Write`, `Read`, `Bash(curl:*)` |
| `--add-dir` | grant access outside cwd — needed if the prompt and helper scripts live in `scripts/development/translate/` while cwd is the blog folder |
| `--model` | which model to use; `sonnet` is the default here |
| `--model`, `--effort` | model and effort selection |
| `--session-id <uuid>` / `--resume` | run the content phase and the template phase as separate invocations that share context |
| `--append-system-prompt` | inject the Blot constraints without displacing the default system prompt |

**Blocking and abort semantics** *(applied only to the abandoned headless
route; with a printed command the operator sees the failure directly)*:

1. **Process exit code.** `spawn`/`execFile` the binary and treat any non-zero
   exit as fatal. Do not swallow it — `translate.sh` should be `set -euo pipefail`
   (as every other script in `scripts/development/` already is) so the failure
   propagates.
2. **A structured refusal channel.** Exit code alone cannot distinguish "finished"
   from "gave up". Give the agent an explicit way to signal being stuck: instruct
   it to write `.verification/BLOCKED.txt` with a reason and stop. The Node
   wrapper checks for that file after the CLI returns and aborts with the reason
   as the error message. A `--json-schema` structured result would work too, but a
   file is simpler and it is also visible to the human operator.
3. **Wall-clock ceiling.** A timeout on the spawned process, so a loop that will
   not converge cannot run indefinitely. Spend ceilings are deliberately *not*
   imposed here — see "Local CLIs only" below.

**Do not use `--dangerously-skip-permissions`** here. The agent is fetching and
processing untrusted third-party HTML, which is exactly the situation where
tool-use guardrails matter. `--permission-mode acceptEdits` with a scoped
`--allowedTools` is the right level.

**Phasing.** Content and template are different jobs with different failure modes.
Running them as two `-p` invocations sharing a `--session-id` keeps context while
letting the wrapper checkpoint between them: read the folder and the target →
propose a structure → build the template → verify visually. If an early phase
fails there is no point starting the next.


#### Multiple agents — investigated, built, then removed

An adapter layer supporting `claude`, `codex` and `cursor-agent` was built and
then taken out along with the headless invocation: with a printed command, the
operator can run whichever agent they like without the script knowing about it.

The findings are kept because they are what a future attempt would need.

**Model discovery is only partly possible, and this is worth knowing before
designing around it:**

| CLI | Enumerate models? |
|---|---|
| `cursor-agent` | **Yes** — `cursor-agent --list-models` prints `id - Label` |
| `claude` | No such command. Accepts aliases (`sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku`) or full model names |
| `codex` | No such command. `-m/--model` accepts a name |

So any adapter interface should ask for a *list* and let each agent satisfy it
however it can — live for cursor-agent, curated for the other two — and should
always accept a typed name, so a curated list never becomes a ceiling.

**No spend ceiling is imposed** anywhere in this design. Only one of the three
CLIs has a budget flag, and each has its own account-level controls. Cost stays
where the credentials are.

**Non-interactive invocation differs per CLI**, which is most of what an adapter
exists to absorb:

```
claude       claude -p "<prompt>" --output-format stream-json --model <m>
codex        codex exec --json --full-auto --model <m> "<prompt>"
cursor-agent cursor-agent -p "<prompt>" --output-format stream-json --model <m> --force
```

Session resumption also differs: `claude` takes a session id we generate,
while `codex exec resume --last` and `cursor-agent --resume` continue the most
recent session in the working directory rather than one we name.

**Portability note:** macOS ships bash 3.2, so the shell layer avoids `mapfile`
and associative arrays.

#### The transcript

Not captured. The operator runs the agent in their own terminal, which is the
transcript, and the CLI keeps its own session history. A stream-JSON formatter
was built for the headless route and removed with it.

### 6.4 The verification loop and the `.verification/` folder

**Named `.verification/` — a dot-directory, deliberately.** The decisive reason is
the operator's packaging workflow: macOS Finder hides dotfiles, so opening the site
folder, pressing Cmd+A and choosing *Compress* silently excludes it. Since the
operator zips by hand (§0.1), that removes the one manual step most likely to be
forgotten. A `_verification/` name would show up in Finder and have to be deleted
every time.

Verified it behaves correctly everywhere that matters:

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Published as a post? | **No** — `isHidden()` returns `true` for `.verification/out.png` (it tests each path segment for a leading `_` or `.`), and `isPublic()` in `sync/update/set.js` catches any path containing `/.` |
| Served over HTTP? | **Yes** — `app/blog/assets.js` sets `dotfiles: "allow"`, and `.verification` is not in `BLOCKED_PATTERNS` (`..`, `.php`, `/.git`, `\0`). So `https://<handle>.local.blot/.verification/input-homepage.png` still works for the operator |
| Ignored by the folder watcher? | **No** — `shouldIgnoreFile(".verification/out.png")` is `false`, so writing a screenshot still triggers one sync. Harmless, but see the `cacheID` note below |
| Hidden from Finder select-all? | **Yes** — which is the point |

Note `/.git` *is* in `BLOCKED_PATTERNS`, so a shipped git repo is never exposed
over HTTP on the customer's site even though `.verification` is.

**Suggested contents:**

```
.verification/
  input-homepage.png     source site, desktop
  output-homepage.png    translated site, desktop
  input-post.png         a representative post on the source
  output-post.png        the same post translated
  input-homepage-mobile.png / output-homepage-mobile.png
  NOTES.md               what the agent changed and what it could not match
  BLOCKED.txt            written only if it gives up (see §6.3)
```

Pairing by an `input-`/`output-` prefix and a shared page label means the agent
can diff a named pair without bookkeeping, and a human can scan them side by side.

**Where puppeteer must run — verified, and it is not obvious.** The screenshot
helper is `app/helper/screenshot` (`screenshot(site, path, options)`, promise,
throws on failure). It is Bottleneck-throttled to one at a time with a 2 s minimum
gap, retries internally, restarts the browser hourly, waits for `networkidle0`
with a 20 s page timeout, and shoots at `deviceScaleFactor: 2` with
`omitBackground: true`. Viewports: `desktop 1260×778`, `mobile 400×650`
(`options.mobile`), overridable via `options.width` / `options.height`.

But **it cannot reach the dev site from inside the container.** Verified:

```
$ docker exec blot-node-app-1 getent hosts example.local.blot
127.0.0.1   example.local.blot
$ docker exec blot-node-app-1 wget -O- --no-check-certificate https://local.blot/health
wget: can't connect to remote host (127.0.0.1): Connection refused
```

Docker's embedded DNS forwards `*.blot` to the host resolver, which answers
`127.0.0.1` — correct on the host, but inside the container that is the container
itself, and nginx is a different container. So container-side screenshots of
`https://<handle>.local.blot` fail.

From the host both work:

```
$ curl -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' https://example.local.blot/    → 200-series routing
```

`/etc/resolver/blot` resolves the wildcard and the mkcert cert is trusted (§1.5).
The host also has its own `puppeteer` 24.1.1 in `node_modules` with a browser in
`~/.cache/puppeteer/chrome` — note `node_modules` is **not** bind-mounted into the
container (the compose file mounts only `data`, `.git`, `app`, `tests`, `notes`,
`scripts`, `TODO`, `config`), so host and container have entirely separate installs.

**So: take screenshots on the host.** Either let Claude drive puppeteer directly,
or provide a small host-side helper the agent can shell out to. Reusing
`app/helper/screenshot` from the host is possible — it only needs `puppeteer`,
`fs-extra`, `bottleneck` and `helper/clfdate` — but it would need `NODE_PATH=app`
set, and its `args.js` passes `--no-sandbox` and other flags tuned for the Alpine
container. A thin standalone wrapper is probably cleaner; the constants worth
copying are the viewports, `networkidle0`, and the retry/throttle behaviour.

`app/templates/screenshots.js` is the existing caller and shows the shape
(`fs.ensureDir(dirname(destination))`, `Promise.race` against a 15 s timeout,
catch-and-continue per shot).

**The loop.** The agent is explicitly free to change *both* sides — folder content
and template source — because a mismatch can legitimately be either. A missing
tag page is a content problem; a wrong font is a template problem; a homepage that
lists posts when the source shows a bespoke landing page is a content problem
solved with `Link: /` metadata. Constraining it to the template would force bad
workarounds.

Each iteration: screenshot both sides → compare → edit → wait for the rebuild
(§6.5) → re-screenshot. Terminate on convergence, on an iteration cap, or on
`BLOCKED.txt`. Worth also checking `?json=true` (render context) and the
template's `metadata.errors` — a Mustache error surfaces there rather than as a
visual difference.


### 6.5 The two README files

**Decision: a file named `README` — no extension — in both places, with Markdown
inside.** This matches what the codebase already does and behaves acceptably in
both locations:

- **At the folder root**, `README` is ignored entirely. Converters match on
  extension (`build/converters/markdown/index.js#is` accepts `.txt .text .md
  .markdown`); an extensionless file matches nothing, so `build` returns
  `WRONGTYPE` and `sync/update/set.js` calls `Ignore(...)`. It never becomes a
  post, and needs no underscore prefix.
- **Inside the template**, `README` becomes a view routed at `/readme`
  (`urlNormalizer` lowercases). Accepted. This is already the established
  convention — `album`, `links`, `magazine`, `portfolio`, `text`, `hypertext` and
  `profile` all ship a `README` in `app/templates/source/` today and have done so
  for years. Template source is public anyway (§4.10), so nothing leaks.

Markdown inside is fine in both: nothing parses either file, so the content is
purely for human and agent readers.

**Root `README` — for whoever edits the content.** Contents:

- What this folder is, which site it was translated from (source URL), and when.
- The folder conventions that apply to *this specific* folder: which directories
  are `Pages/`, the date-path scheme in use, which `[Bracket]` tags exist and what
  they map to on the source site, why assets carry a `_` prefix.
- The metadata block format and which keys this site actually uses.
- Where the template lives, and that editing `Templates/<slug>/` changes the design.
- Anything the translation could not reproduce, and why — this is the honest
  handover note, and the most valuable part.

**Template `README` — for whoever edits the design.** Essentially the
`AGENTS.md` brief from `/developers/guides/working-with-ai`, which Blot ships for
exactly this purpose. Contents:

- That this is a Blot template, and the Mustache rules (escaping, `{{{ }}}`,
  partials, inline `package.json` partials).
- The hard constraints from §4.10 — no subdirectories, no SCSS, 2 MB cap, no
  basename collisions.
- Which view maps to which URL, and the reminder to check `views[*].url` in
  `package.json` because the default route keeps the file extension (§4.4).
- The locals this template actually uses and where they come from.
- The `?json=true` inspection loop.
- The portability rules (§5.2): no hardcoded hosts, CDN origins, or blog IDs.

Both stay in the folder and go to the customer. Note the template `README` also
serves as the brief for the *next* agent that edits the folder, which is the point
— the deliverable carries its own onboarding.


### 6.6 Operator guidance: feedback and a comparison UI

Two mechanisms, both worth building, and they compose.

#### 6.6.1 Typed feedback between agent turns

`claude -p` returns after each invocation, so the natural shape is a loop the
operator drives:

```
run agent → screenshots → show comparison → prompt operator
   ↳ [Enter]  accept, move to packaging
   ↳ text     resume the session with that feedback, loop again
   ↳ q        abort without packaging
```

**Resuming with context is the important part.** From `claude --help` (2.1.47):
`--session-id <uuid>` pins a session on the first run, and `--resume <uuid>`
continues it with full history — so feedback like "the nav should be horizontal,
and the photo posts should be tagged" lands in a conversation that already knows
what it built and why. `--continue` resumes the most recent conversation in the
current directory and avoids tracking a UUID, but is implicit and breaks if
anything else runs `claude` in that folder. Prefer an explicit `--session-id`
stored in the run state (§6.7). Do **not** pass `--no-session-persistence`; it
disables exactly this.

**Reading the feedback.** `scripts/util/getConfirmation.js` is the existing
pattern — plain `readline.createInterface` over stdin, promise-returning with an
optional callback. It only handles y/n; a `getFeedback` sibling taking free text
(empty line = accept) is a small extension of the same shape. For longer notes,
shelling out to `$EDITOR` is an option, but a single readline prompt matches the
rest of `scripts/`.

Note this requires a TTY, so `translate.sh` must not be run in a pipeline that
detaches stdin. `npm run login` already uses `docker exec -it`, so interactive
scripts are established here.

#### 6.6.2 A local comparison UI

**Precedent:** `scripts/development/open-folder-server.js` is exactly this pattern
already — a plain `http.createServer` on a fixed port (3020), launched in the
background by `start.sh`, driving `spawn("open", …)` on macOS. A translate
comparison server can copy it wholesale. **Port 3021 is free** (verified: only
3020 and 8080 are listening locally; the project otherwise uses 80, 443, 6379,
8474 and `clients_port: 8888`).

**The framing constraint, which shapes the design.** `app/server.js:53-77` sets on
every Blot response:

```
X-Frame-Options: ALLOW-FROM <config.host>
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self' https://local.blot
```

So a UI served from `http://localhost:3021` **cannot** iframe
`https://<handle>.local.blot` — `frame-ancestors` does not include it, and
`ALLOW-FROM` is deprecated and ignored by modern browsers anyway, leaving CSP in
charge.

**The escape hatch:** preview subdomains strip both headers.
`app/blog/vhosts.js:100-101` calls `res.removeHeader("X-Frame-Options")` and
`res.removeHeader("Content-Security-Policy")` whenever `previewTemplate` is set,
precisely so the dashboard's template editor can embed the page. `app/blog/draft.js:86-87`
does the same for `/_draft/*`. So the local Blot site **is** iframeable at:

```
https://preview-of-my-<template-slug>-on-<handle>.local.blot/
```

`app/views/dashboard/template/js/template-editor-preview-iframe.js` is the working
implementation of that pattern — including a desktop/mobile view toggle and
`localStorage` persistence of the previewed path. Worth reading before writing a
new one.

**The target site is the harder half.** Most real sites send
`X-Frame-Options: DENY`/`SAMEORIGIN` or `frame-ancestors 'self'`, and there is no
way around that from a browser. So a live-vs-live iframe comparison will fail on a
large fraction of source sites.

**Therefore: make the UI screenshot-first.** Serve the `.verification/` PNG pairs
side by side — they always work, they are what the agent itself is comparing, and
they capture the state at the moment of the last run. Layer extras on top where
possible:

- a live iframe of the Blot side via the preview subdomain, next to the target
  screenshot;
- plain links that open each site in a real tab (always works, zero constraints);
- a slider or opacity-blend between the two PNGs, which is far better than
  side-by-side for spotting layout drift;
- a textarea that POSTs feedback back to the server, so the operator can type into
  the browser instead of the terminal — the same string then goes to
  `claude --resume`.

That last point makes the UI and the feedback loop one mechanism rather than two:
the server holds the pending feedback, the shell loop reads it, and the operator
never has to switch windows.


### 6.7 Idempotency and re-runs

**Goal: re-running `translate <url>` continues rather than starts over, and asks
for guidance up front.**

**Detecting a re-run.** Two signals, in order of reliability:

1. **A run-state file** written by the first run, keyed by source URL. Store:
   source URL, `blogID`, handle, template slug, the Claude `--session-id`, run
   count and timestamps. **Decided: `data/tmp/translate/<handle>.json`** via
   `helper/tempDir()` — where the importers already stage working state, and
   safely outside the blog folder, so it can never end up in the operator's zip.
2. **Handle lookup.** `Blog.get({ handle })` — `app/templates/folders/setupBlogs.js`
   is the precedent: reuse the blog if it exists, throw if it is owned by another
   user, otherwise create. That alone makes provisioning idempotent even with no
   state file.

**Re-run flow:**

```
translate <url>
  ├─ preflight (§1.5)
  ├─ state found for <url>?
  │    ├─ no  → provision, scaffold, content gate, run agent with a new --session-id
  │    └─ yes → print a summary (site URL, run count, last run time)
  │             skip the content gate — content is already there
  │             prompt immediately for optional feedback  ← the ask
  │             claude --resume <session-id> with that feedback prepended
  └─ verify → finalize (§5.1) → print folder path
```

Asking for feedback *before* doing any work on a re-run is right: the operator
already knows what they disliked, and the agent should not spend a turn
rediscovering it.

**What must be idempotent underneath:**

- **Provisioning** — reuse the blog by handle rather than creating a second one
  (`setupBlogs.js` pattern). Same for the template: `Template.create` returns
  `err.code === "EEXISTS"` if the ID already exists, so catch and reuse.
- **Content is not touched on a re-run.** This is the big simplification from
  splitting acquisition out: there is no re-crawl, no output directory to clear,
  and none of the duplicate-or-wipe hazards that come with re-running an importer
  into a populated folder. Content changes are the operator's business — they can
  copy in an updated folder, or re-run `dynamic-importer` separately.
- **Templates** — `writeToFolder` removes orphaned files and skips writes whose
  content is byte-identical, so it is naturally idempotent. `buildFromFolder`
  drops locally-edited templates whose directory has disappeared.
- **Screenshots** overwrite in place so `.verification/` always reflects the latest
  run; if history is wanted, add a run-numbered subdirectory.

Because re-runs reuse the site, dev sites do not accumulate — one per translated
URL, reused indefinitely.


### 6.8 What the Claude Code CLI is asked to do

Working directory: `data/blogs/<blogID>/`.

**Step 1 — read the content.** Inspect what is actually in the folder before
designing for it (§3.3): how many posts, whether they are dated, whether `Pages/`
exists, which tags are in use, whether a page claims `Link: /`. The template is
built for *this* folder, not for a generic Blot site.

**Step 2 — study the target.** Fetch `<url>` and work out its structure: layout,
type, colour, navigation, how the index presents posts, what a single post looks
like.

**Step 3 — template.** Edit `Templates/<slug>/*` so the rendered site matches the
source design, using only the locals in §4.6 and respecting §4.10.

**Step 4 — verify and iterate.** Screenshot both sides into `.verification/`,
compare, and fix — in either the template or the content (§6.4, §3.3). Write
`.verification/BLOCKED.txt` and stop if genuinely stuck.

The brief handed to the CLI should extend `/developers/guides/working-with-ai`
with:
- the retrievable-locals list (§4.6)
- the entry-property list (§3.4)
- the folder conventions that shape a template (§3.3)
- the `package.json` schema (§4.3) and the default-route gotcha (§4.4)
- the dashboard-control naming conventions (§4.9)
- **the portability rules from §5.2** — since the output ships to a customer, the
  agent must not hardcode the dev CDN origin, the dev host, or the blog ID
  anywhere in the template or content
- that content edits are permitted and when they are the right fix (§3.3)

Keep the brief in `scripts/development/translate/` and pass `--add-dir` rather
than writing it into the blog folder — otherwise it becomes part of the
deliverable the customer receives.


### 6.9 Forcing a rebuild if the watcher misses changes

Inside the container:

```js
const sync = require("sync");
sync(blogID, (err, folder, done) => {
  folder.update("/path/that/changed", () => done(null, () => {}));
});
```

`app/templates/folders/index.js#applyChanges` is a promisified working version
that also calls `sync/fix`. Templates specifically can be rebuilt with
`Template.buildFromFolder(blogID, cb)` — and `sync()` already calls it on lock
release.


### 6.10 Version-controlling the folder

**Making the blog folder a git repo and having the agent commit as it goes is a
good fit**, and the codebase already does something similar: `scripts/test/setup-restore-git-test.js`
inits a git repo *inside a blog's template directory*. The value here is concrete:

- every agent turn becomes a reviewable diff, so the operator can see exactly what
  changed between iterations rather than inferring it from screenshots;
- a bad iteration is `git revert`, not a re-run;
- the content can be committed *as the operator supplied it*, before the agent
  touches anything, which cleanly separates "what arrived" from "what the agent
  changed" — valuable precisely because the agent is allowed to edit content
  (§3.3);
- `git status` is a precise answer to "did the agent actually change anything".

Suggested commit points: after provisioning, after the content gate (§3.2), after
each agent turn, and after each operator-feedback round — with the feedback text as
the commit message, which makes the log a record of the conversation.

**Blot ignores `.git` as content**, so nothing gets published:
`clients/util/shouldIgnoreFile` lists `.git` in `IGNORED_SYSTEM_FILES` (verified:
`/.git/objects/…`, `/.git/index`, `/.git/HEAD` all return `true`), and
`sync/update/set.js#isPublic` treats any path containing `/.` as a static file
rather than an entry.

**Decided: a plain `git init` in the blog folder, and the history stays local.**
The repo is a working tool for the run — diffing agent turns, separating importer
output from agent fixes, rolling back a bad iteration — not part of the handover.
The customer receives the site; the provenance stays on the operator's machine.

**This falls out of the packaging workflow for free.** The operator zips by opening
the folder in Finder, selecting all, and compressing. Finder hides dotfiles, so
`.git` is excluded by the same mechanism that excludes `.verification/` (§6.4).
Nothing to remember and nothing to clean up — the default behaviour is the correct
behaviour. (If history ever *should* be handed over, zip the folder itself rather
than its contents, and delete `.verification/` first.)

**The sync-churn problem this used to have is fixed.** `app/clients/local/setup.js`
previously watched the folder with no ignore patterns, so every `.git` internal
write ran a full sync cycle — lock, `folder.update`, rename check,
`Template.buildFromFolder`, `cacheID` bump. Commit `4d276a06a` added
`ignored: shouldIgnoreFile` to the `chokidar.watch` call. Measured before and
after on this machine:

| Operation | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `git init` + `add` + commit (1 file) | 42 syncs | **1** (the content file) |
| New file + commit | — | **1** |
| Empty commit, no content change | — | **0** |

The 42 were `/.git/objects/**`, `/.git/refs/**`, `/.git/logs/**`, `/.git/index`
and so on, one full cycle each. Git operations are now invisible to the watcher,
and `git init --separate-git-dir` is no longer needed as a workaround.

**Notes:**

- **Add a `.gitignore` excluding `.verification/`.** The screenshots are large
  PNGs at `deviceScaleFactor: 2`, regenerated every iteration; committing them
  churns the repo for no benefit, since the operator compares them live rather
  than historically. A dotfile at the folder root is ignored as content by
  `isPublic` (any path containing `/.`), so it costs nothing.
- **Blot never publishes or serves `.git`.** `shouldIgnoreFile` lists it in
  `IGNORED_SYSTEM_FILES` (verified for `/.git/objects/…`, `/.git/index`,
  `/.git/HEAD`), and `/.git` is in `BLOCKED_PATTERNS` in `app/blog/assets.js`, so
  it 404s over HTTP. Harmless even in the unlikely case a repo does reach a live
  site.
- **Commit messages are for the operator, not a customer** — optimise them for
  reviewing what changed between turns.

Create the repo at provisioning time so the very first acquisition is committed
against an empty tree — that is what makes "importer output vs agent fixes"
legible as a diff.


---

## 7. Decisions and remaining questions

### 7.1 Settled

| Question | Decision | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Scope | Template only. Content acquisition lives in `dynamic-importer` or the dashboard importers | intro, §3.1 |
| Dev account | `example@example.com` — a hardcoded literal, not config | §2.1 |
| Starting the stack | No. Preflight against `/health` and abort telling the operator to run `npm start` | §1.5 |
| Deliverable | The folder itself. **No zipping in the script** — the operator zips manually after review | §0.1, §5 |
| Customer install | `"enabled": true` in the template's `package.json`, written to disk and re-asserted at the end of every run | §5.1 |
| Content handoff | Operator moves content in; the script **verifies entries built** rather than trusting a keypress | §3.2 |
| Agent may edit content | Yes — some design mismatches are content problems, and git makes the edits reviewable | §3.3, §6.4 |
| Template scaffold | Clone `SITE:blog` — take the working boilerplate, instruct the agent to treat it as structure, not as a look | §6.2 |
| Invoking the agent | **The script does not.** It writes `.verification/brief.md` and prints `cd <folder> && claude --model sonnet "$(cat .verification/brief.md)"` for the operator to run in another window | §6.3 |
| Agent and model | `claude`, `sonnet`. Presence checked at preflight; `TRANSLATE_MODEL` overrides | §6.3 |
| Spend ceilings | Not imposed; cost stays with the credentials | §6.3 |
| Agent transcript | Not captured — the operator's terminal is the transcript | §6.3 |
| The loop | Re-running the script. It commits the round, re-screenshots, refreshes the comparison and folds in any feedback | §6.7 |
| Verification folder | `.verification/` — dot-named so Finder select-all excludes it; still served over HTTP for the operator | §6.4 |
| READMEs | Two, both named `README`, no extension, Markdown inside. Ignored at the folder root; becomes a `/readme` view in the template, which is accepted and matches seven shipped templates | §6.5 |
| Comparison UI | Screenshot pairs + opacity-blend slider + open-in-tab links + feedback textarea, served on port 3021 | §6.6.2 |
| Feedback channel | Both — browser textarea and terminal prompt, with the server holding pending feedback the shell loop reads | §6.6 |
| Re-runs | Reuse the site by handle; skip the content gate; prompt for guidance up front; resume the Claude session | §6.7 |
| Version control | Plain `git init` in the blog folder, **history stays local** — Finder's select-all zip excludes dotfiles | §6.10 |
| Watcher reliability | **Tested — works** for creates, nested creates and deletes. No `--rebuild` fallback needed | §1.2 |

### 7.2 Defaults taken (say so if you disagree)

| # | Question | Default |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Run-state location | `data/tmp/translate/<handle>.json` via `helper/tempDir()` — outside the blog folder |
| 2 | Handle derivation | Deterministic from the URL: strip scheme, `www.` and TLD, lowercase, strip to alnum, numeric suffix on collision. Must be stable across runs or re-run detection breaks |
| 3 | Rebuild wait | Poll `blog.cacheID` until it stops changing — it is bumped at the end of every sync. **Order matters:** `.verification/` is not ignored by the watcher, so writing screenshots itself bumps `cacheID`. Settle first, *then* screenshot |
| 4 | Screenshot helper | Standalone host-side wrapper, copying the viewports (`1260×778` / `400×650`), `networkidle0` wait and retry/throttle behaviour from `app/helper/screenshot` rather than importing it — its `args.js` is tuned for Alpine |
| 5 | Iteration cap | Agent inner loop capped around 5 rounds. The operator is the real stop condition; no spend ceiling is imposed by this script |
| 6 | Tool allowlist | `Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, WebFetch, Bash(node:*)` — no unrestricted `Bash` |

### 7.3 Resolved externally

- **Chokidar ignore patterns in `app/clients/local/setup.js` — DONE**, commit
  `4d276a06a` "Ignore file events in local client". Adds `ignored: shouldIgnoreFile`
  to the `chokidar.watch` call. Re-measured against the running stack:

  | Operation | Before | After |
  |---|---|---|
  | `git init` + `add` + commit (1 file) | 42 syncs | **1** (for the content file) |
  | New file + commit | — | **1** |
  | Empty commit, no content change | — | **0** |

  Reusing `shouldIgnoreFile` rather than a `.git`-specific regex is the better
  hook: it splits on both separators and tests every path component against the
  same ignore sets the write path already uses, so it works on relative and
  absolute paths and sweeps up `.DS_Store`, `._*`, `~$*` and `.swp` at the same
  time.

### 7.4 Still genuinely open

Nothing blocking remains. Both items below were resolved by taking a default
rather than a deliberate choice — flag them if you disagree:

1. **What "converged" means for the agent's inner loop** (§6.4) — taken as: the
   agent declares itself done and the operator decides for real. Image diffing is
   a weak proxy for design fidelity, and a human is in the loop anyway.
2. **Whether the content gate should offer to run `dynamic-importer` for the
   operator** (§3.1) — taken as: no, it only prints the routes and waits. Keeping
   the two tools uncoupled was the point of splitting them, and the operator may
   well be using the dashboard importer or an existing folder instead.

### 7.5 Not a question — just must not be forgotten

**Non-goals to state explicitly in the agent's brief.** Blot has no Sass, no view
subdirectories, no server-side JS in templates, and no per-request logic beyond
Mustache sections and the whitelisted locals. Source sites relying on client-side
frameworks need that behaviour reimplemented as plain CSS/JS. This has to be
written down where the agent will see it (§4.10, §6.8).

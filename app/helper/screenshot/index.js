// Page.captureScreenshot when several tabs of one instance capture at the same
// time, so a screenshot never shares an instance with another screenshot. At
// the default concurrency of one that is a single long-lived browser.
//
// In airlock mode (REMOTE_BROWSER_URL set) there is only ever one real
// Chromium process to talk to - it lives in the airlock container, shared
// with every other container connected to it - so "the pool" holds at most
// one entry: a connect()ed wrapper rather than a launch()ed one. See launch()
// and close() below for how the two are told apart, and takeScreenshot() for
// why the remote case additionally isolates each screenshot in its own
// incognito browser context. Bottleneck's concurrency limit only serializes
// screenshots WITHIN this one process, though - it says nothing about
// whatever blue/green/yellow are doing on their own copies of this module -
// so the "never shares an instance with another screenshot" invariant above
// would otherwise break across containers sharing one airlock. See
// AIRLOCK_LOCK_PATH and takeScreenshot() for the cross-container mutex that
// restores it for the remote case.

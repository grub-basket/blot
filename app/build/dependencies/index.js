// Make a resolved filesystem path safe to drop into an HTML attribute
// without changing which file it points at. We only percent-encode the
// characters a browser would otherwise read as URL syntax or that can't
// appear in an attribute value at all:
//
//   - "#" and "?", which would start a fragment or query;
//   - a "%" that isn't already the start of a valid "%HH" escape, so
//     paths that already contain percent-encoding (e.g. "%20", "%C3%A9"
//     from the Markdown converter or a hand-written link) round-trip
//     unchanged instead of being double-encoded;
//   - spaces, control characters and the HTML-significant < > " ` .
//
// Everything else - "/" separators, reserved characters that are still
// legal inside a path segment (: @ + = & ; ,), and non-ASCII
// characters - is left untouched so the value still decodes back to the
// exact path recorded as a dependency.
//
// Two accepted edge cases. First: static asset requests are decoded
// with decodeURIComponent (app/blog/assets.js), which restores every
// escape, but Entry.getByUrl and the image transformer use decodeURI,
// which leaves "%23"/"%3F" encoded - so a folder whose name literally
// contains "#" or "?" is still served as a static file but misses
// image-cache optimization. Second: an existing "%HH" is assumed to be
// pre-encoding rather than a literal "%", so a file literally named
// e.g. "50%FF.png" would need its "%" doubled by hand.

// The purpose of this module is to take the HTML for
// a given blog post and work out if it references any
// files in the user's folder. For example, this image
// does: <img src="apple.png"> but this video doesn't:
// <video><source src="//example.com/movie.mp4"></video>
// Our goal is to first resolve all relative file paths
// then determine the list of dependencies. This modifies
// the HTML passed to it.
//
// This includes <a href> as well as <img src> and friends: a
// relative link to a local file is resolved against the file's
// location in the user's folder, not the URL of the post it
// appears on – those are frequently different (e.g. the default
// permalink format is just {{slug}}, unrelated to folder layout).
// This is a deliberate breaking change: previously a relative
// <a href> to a local file was left untouched by the build
// pipeline and resolved (incorrectly, in most cases) against the
// post's published URL by the browser instead.
//
// A relative <a href> is resolved exactly like a relative
// src – no extension filtering, no check that the file exists.
// A link to another post's source file (e.g. other-post.md, or
// page.html) resolves directly to that file, the same as it
// would for an <img src>; it is not resolved against that post's
// permalink. For anything already tagged as a wikilink
// (title="wikilink") - emitted directly from [[...]] syntax by the
// markdown converter - we still track the resolved guess as a
// dependency, but don't rewrite the attribute: the wikilinks
// plugin, which runs after this module, resolves those from their
// original, unresolved target text.
//
// KNOWN EDGE CASE (accepted, not solved): if a relative <a href>
// resolves to a path that happens to be identical to some other
// entry's custom permalink, app/build/prepare/internalLinks.js has
// no way to tell "this is a resolved file reference" apart from "this
// is a real link to that entry" - it'll be counted as the latter,
// producing a spurious backlink on that entry's page. This requires
// an exact, coincidental collision between a resolved file path and
// someone's custom permalink, which is extraordinarily unlikely, and
// the worst case is one wrong entry in a backlinks list - not a
// broken link or lost data. An earlier version of this module threaded
// a "credit" system through here, single.js, and internalLinks.js to
// distinguish the two cases precisely, but the complexity wasn't
// worth what it protected against, so it was removed.
